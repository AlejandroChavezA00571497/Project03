/* Introduction */

This project is based on an income dataset from different data science and tech related positions in the USA during the period of 2017-2018.

/* Development of the project: Task Breakdown */

The analysis process were broken into two principal parts: (1) exploration and cleanup, and (2) analysis
Exploration: recognize the dataset useful information, clean, and reformat in order to answer the principal questions. Our first intention were develop the project in a Jupyter notebook to keep track of the exploration steps but every final code were enclosed in the Main folder of our project.

We used SQLAlchemy to rearrenge some data and finally obtain an SQLite database that let us use important information through the elaboration of an API using FLASK. 

The process of analysis were based on different techniques such as: aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time-series analysis every time it was possible. 

Every interesting finding were shown in a plot (or data visualization) during the exploration and/or analysis phases (using Leaflet or Plotly and some JS library we didnâ€™t cover in the course).
The final results must be delivered in a dashboard page (Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript) by user-driven interaction (menus, dropdowns, textboxes). 

We used as an aditional JS library Chart.js that were very well documentated and very appealing to the eye. 

The libraries used to make visualizations in this project were: D3, Plotlib, Leatlef and Chart.js.

/* Some Research Questions */

This are some of the Qs we found interesting during the exploring and cleaning of the data

Which geographical regions offer the best salaries?
What role has the highest income?
Do men in data science earn more than women?
Does it make a difference to hold a higher degree? 
How much do years of experience affect the total compensation
Men/women rate per company
More inclusive companies (according to ethnicity) 

/* Presentation and Results */

There were some very interesting findings and surprises of the visualizations, some of the results can be visualized here:
